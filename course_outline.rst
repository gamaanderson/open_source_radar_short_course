Introduction
------------

Time to settle in and say hello. Course tutors will open the course and introduce themselves and their projects, as well as the general structure and concept of the short course. 


Collaborative Software Development
----------------------------------

We will provide a "real-time" demonstration of collaborative development based on a Distributed Version Control System. 

   .. admonition:: Comment by maik

      Py-ART and BALTRAD use git+github while wradlib uses hg+bitbucket. We should only present one of those... git+github might be more common. 
   
The Virtual Machine (VM) already comes with hg and git clients so everyone will be set. Course tutors will demonstrate the following steps::

   User 1
   
      Get github account
       
      Create an empty repository on github

      Clone the repository to local machine

      Add some content to local repository

      Commit the changes to local repository

      Push the changes to github

      Add user 2 as a co-developer with write permission

   User 2
   
      Clone repository

      Apply some local changes
 
      Commit the changes locally

      Push the changes to github
	  
   User 1
   
      Pull the changes

...

   .. admonition:: Comment by maik

      Ok, we should not overreach; however, we should at least address resolving of conflicts and demonstration of the Fork & Pull concept. 

Then course participants can create their own account and a github or bitbucket repository which they will use to host the code they wrote during the course.


Python Quick Start
------------------

   .. admonition:: Comments by Maik and Daniel

      Maik: @JJ: Didn't you give a quick tutorial at AMS which we could use as a basis?
   
      Otherwise, we should use http://scipy-lectures.github.io/ as a basis to select from.

   Daniel: Based on experiences from BALTRAD, where different people had (and continue to have) their personal preferences when it comes to IDE, I don't think we need to deal with IPython at this short course, as it's just one IDE among many. In the end, the important thing is the code, not how or with what it is written. I also share Maik's concern about legibility of IPython's files outside IPython.

The Python quick start should cover e.g.::

   - Installing Python, Python distributions / scientific stacks, most important dependencies
   
   - Starting Python from the shell and "hello world"
   
   - Executing a Python script
   
   - Interactive programming using the IPython notebook
   
   - General guidelines on programming style and syntax in Python
   
   - Control flow
   
   - Array operations in Numpy

   - Plotting with matplotlib


Hands on Py-ART
---------------

@Scott and JJ: Please fill in your content.


Hands on wradlib
----------------

Overview::

   - Brief history and background

   - Package structure and modules

   - How to install and use?

   - wradlib's "flat data model"  

   - How to contribute?

Example::

   - Read polar DX data from German Weather Service
   
   - Clutter detection and removal
   
   - Georeferencing and plotting a PPI
   
   - ...


Hands on BALTRAD
----------------

Overview::

    - Brief history and background

    - Development paradigm

    - Package structure and modules

    - ODIM_H5: the OPERA Data Information Model for use with the HDF5 file format

    - How to contribute

Examples::

    - Read polar data and see how they're represented

    - Quality controls and the quality management infrastructure

    - Processing a lot of data at once

    - Generating composites/mosaics


Interoperability Demonstration Experiment
-----------------------------------------

Demonstrate pairwise interaction between the presented OSS tools::

   Py-ART and BALTRAD talk to each other.
   
   BALTRAD and wradlib talk to each other.


Feedback round
--------------

We will discuss, together with the participants, the perspectives for using OSS software in different institutional environments. Participants are invited to feedback on their impression of the presented OSS tools and whether these tools are an option for their future activities.
